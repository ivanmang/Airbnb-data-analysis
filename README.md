## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
Using Boston Airbnb Open Data and Seattle Airbnb Open Data, we are interested to better understand:
1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Boston and Seattle ? By how much do prices spike?
2. How well can we predict the price of the listing? Which features affect the price the most?
3. Which type of host tends to have better review?

## File Descriptions
There is three jupyter notebook available here. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. You can start with `price_pattern.ipynb`  for the first question, 
`price_predict.ipynb` for the second and `host_and_review.ipynb` for the last.
